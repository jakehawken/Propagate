/**
 Promise is the object responsible for creating and completing a future. Generically typed `Promise<T,E>`,
 where `T` is the success type and `E` is the error type.
 
 Promises/Futures are for single-use events and can only be completed (resolved/rejected) once. Subsequent
 completion attempts will be no-ops.
 
 In typical use, the promise is not revealed to the consumer of the future. A method returns a future and
 privately completes the promise on completion of the asynchronous work.
